This application serves the purpose of learning how to create a Ruby on Rails portable virtual environment with Chef and Vagrant.

## Remarks

Use root access for vagrant commands to avoid potential errors, examples are as follows:
- sudo vagrant up
- sudo vagrant provision
- sudo vagrant destroy 

Access application here when VM is running:
